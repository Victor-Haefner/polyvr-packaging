polyvr-packaging
================

Packaging scripts for PolyVR and dependencies 
for different platforms.

Currently we support only Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Ports to Windows and Mac are on our roadmap.

The scripts in this repository are ment for 
packaging the dependencies as libraries and 
the PolyVR binary. Those packages are hostet
in the polyvr-depends repository on GitHub.
